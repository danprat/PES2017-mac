// the command processor's end-of-pipe event -- reaches the fence, and the caller

// main thread at 100% of a big core, 40% of it in clock_gettime for the title's
// own timeout arithmetic, to wait out the 16 ms the GPU needs for a frame. When
// the answer is "still waiting", give the processor away first: the GPU thread
// that will move the word gets it, and the phone stays cool.
